Why? Because the dataset didn‚Äôt fully represent the breadth of real-world scenarios:\n\n- **System diversity was limited**: Most data points were from mid-range setups, neglecting low-end and high-end systems.\n- **Training durations were narrow**: Many samples captured ‚Äúaverage‚Äù training times but missed edge cases like extremely short or prolonged sessions.\n\nThis lack of diversity in the dataset meant the model was essentially ‚Äúoverfitted‚Äù to a narrow slice of reality.\n\n---\n\n### What Did I Do to Fix It?\n\n#### Step 1: Expanding Dataset Diversity\n\nTo improve representation, I expanded the dataset to include:\n\n- Low-end systems with limited computational resources.\n- High-end systems with advanced hardware specs.\n- Training durations spanning from seconds to days.\n\n#### **System Diversity**\nThe first step in the expansion was addressing the imbalance in system specifications. Many data points were clustered around mid-range systems, leaving low-end and high-end systems underrepresented. By including a broader range of system configurations, we achieved a more balanced dataset.\n\n![Improved representation: This scatter plot shows the relationship between system specifications and training durations, capturing the diversity added during dataset expansion.](images/scatterplot-system-training.png)\n\n#### **Training Duration Diversity**\nIn addition to system diversity, I expanded the range of training durations. The original dataset primarily focused on average training times, which neglected edge cases like extremely short or prolonged sessions. The inclusion of mid-range and long durations improved the model‚Äôs ability to generalize.\n\n![This boxplot highlights the improved diversity in training durations after dataset expansion, ensuring better representation of real-world scenarios.](images/boxplot-training-durations.png)\n\nThis expansion brought much-needed variety, but it also introduced new challenges. For instance, the additional data created noise, causing the model‚Äôs performance to temporarily decline. This was my first lesson: **balancing dataset diversity and noise is an art.**\n\n---\n\n### Key Lessons Learned\n\n![An infographic summarizing the three lessons‚Äîrepresentation, balance, and iteration.](path-to-image4.png)\n\nHere are the core takeaways from my experience:\n\n1. **Real-World Representation is Critical**  \n   A model‚Äôs success depends on how well its training dataset mirrors the scenarios it will encounter in production. Without this alignment, even a high-accuracy model can fail spectacularly.\n\n2. **Balancing Diversity is a Delicate Process**  \n   Simply adding more data isn‚Äôt enough. Dataset diversity needs to be carefully curated to ensure the model learns meaningful patterns without being overwhelmed by noise.\n\n3. **Iteration is Essential**  \n   Improving dataset representation is not a one-time fix. It requires continuous refinement and evaluation to align the model with real-world complexities.\n\n---\n\n### Broader Implications\n\n![A flowchart showing how dataset diversity affects predictions across domains like healthcare, NLP, and finance.](path-to-image5.png)\n\nThis issue extends far beyond my project. Here are some real-world examples where dataset representation matters:\n\n- **Healthcare**: Predictive models trained on non-representative patient demographics may lead to biased medical decisions.\n- **Natural Language Processing**: Chatbots trained on limited dialects or languages struggle to serve diverse populations.\n- **Finance**: Risk models trained on historical data can perpetuate systemic biases if certain groups are underrepresented.\n\n---\n\n### Tools and Techniques for Better Representation\n\n![A visual guide to tools like SMOTE, EDA techniques, and validation strategies.](path-to-image6.png)\n\nIf you‚Äôre grappling with similar challenges, here are some strategies to improve dataset representation:\n\n1. **Use EDA to Identify Gaps**  \n   Visualize your data to spot underrepresented groups or scenarios.\n\n2. **Leverage Synthetic Data**  \n   Tools like SMOTE can help augment data in underrepresented categories.\n\n3. **Validate on Diverse Scenarios**  \n   Test your model on edge cases and real-world setups to catch weaknesses early.\n\n4. **Iterate and Refine**  \n   Treat data preparation as an ongoing process, not a one-off task.\n\n---\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nPredicting ML runtime isn‚Äôt just an academic exercise; it‚Äôs a real-world problem with practical stakes:\n\n- **Efficient Resource Allocation**: Accurate predictions help teams optimize hardware usage and reduce costs.\n- **Realistic Expectations**: Stakeholders can plan timelines effectively, avoiding unnecessary delays or inefficiencies.\n\n![A workflow diagram showing how better predictions impact project timelines and resource management.](path-to-image7.png)\n\nWithout a dataset that truly reflects the problem space, predictions can lead to wasted resources or poor decision-making.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nThis project reinforced the critical role of data diversity and quality in machine learning.
